Patch 7 Hotfix 1 (06/15/24):
// Renamed "9K121 Vikhr" (A3: Skalpel) to "AGM-114R Hellfire X" from ace3's realsticnames. 
*A (fictional) futuristic version ("X") of the AGM-114R Hellfire Romeo due to how less chonky it looks and more in shape with the "9K121 Vikhr". Aegis' AH-64D/E also uses these Hellfires (and it would be jarring if left as Vikhr instead of Hellfire).

6/14/24 AEGIS SUITE MOD COMPATIBILITY PATCHES ADDED
*These compatibility patches will be applied if you have these mods loaded. HOWEVER!!! Make sure to load Realistic Names mod LAST (at the very bottom) of your Arma 3 Addon Launcher (after Aegis), as Aegis can overwrite the realistic names again.

> Added Realistic Names compatbility to the following AEGIS mods:
- Arma 3 Aegis, Aegis - Marines, Aegis - Police, Athena, Atlas, Atlas - Opposing Forces, RevoluciÃ³n
*Changed fictional 2035 naming for weapons, attachments, and vehicles to their real-life counterpart.
- Added Compat Patch for "Campaign Compatible ACE (works w Old Man too !)"
*Made a compat patch to overwrite the old ace realisticnames module that this version still uses.
