# Arma 3 Realistic Names UPDATED

This project aims to provide a small mod that changes the names of Weapons, Vehicles and Gear in Arma 3 to their real life names. Since this is a feature of [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) already, this mod makes use of it by simply stripping it out and distributing it standalone. 

# Getting started

This mod requires Arma 3 and the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/releases">CBA A3</a>.

# Disclaimer

I am not the original author of this mod (blackfisch is). However, the Original RealisticNames mod by blackfisch is no longer being updated as the repository has been archived by the owner on Jul 3, 2022 and there still isn't an automated build system.
- https://github.com/blackfisch/Arma3-RealisticNames
So I've taken the reins where all future builds will be done manually by me.

This project basically is a Standalone of the [realisticnames module](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/tree/master/addons/realisticnames) from [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3).

Special Thanks to all [ACE3 Contributors](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) who made this project possible in the first place.
