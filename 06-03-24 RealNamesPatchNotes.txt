Patch 6 Hotfix 1 (06/03/24):
+ For Western Sahara CDLC by Rotators Collective:
// VEHICLE WEAPONS
// Renamed to change the "SPMG .338" turret mount for RF Pickup to "LWMMG".
- "SPMG .338" -> "LWMMG"

+ For Vanilla, Apex, Contact, Jets, Laws of War Assets by Bohemia Interactive:
// PRIMARY WEAPONS
// Renamed "CZ 581" to "CZ/DT11 Drake". *This shotgun is a fusion that is modelled after the Beretta DT-11 but with elements from the CZ Drake. Specifically the design of the top lever (being straight (Drake) than slanted (DT11)), the 11 gaps for the ventilated rib above the barell (Drake). However, the action's (curved) concave on the wood (above, right of the trigger) is directly from the DT11 (the Drake is sharp).
- "CZ 581" -> "CZ/DT11 Drake"
// Renamed "CZ 581 (Sawed-Off)" to "CZ/DT11 Drake (Sawed-Off)". 
- "CZ 581 (Sawed-Off)" -> "CZ/DT11 Drake (Sawed-Off)"

Patch 6 (06/02/24):
- All vehicles and static "HMG"s (that use a visible M2HB) were renamed to "M2HB" as that is what the HMG is directly modelled after.
* The RCWS (Remote Controlled Weapon Station) turrets on specific armored vehicles (ex: M-ATV, Fennek, Karatel, Crusher UGCV) are left unedited since it is a fictional turret created by Bohemia Interactive that utilize either an HMG (M2HB), GMG (HKGMG?), or both.
