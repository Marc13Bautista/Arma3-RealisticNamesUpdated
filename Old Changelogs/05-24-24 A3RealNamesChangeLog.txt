WS & RF COMPAT UPDATE TLDR CHANGELIST:
- Added Real Names for the following mods: JCA M320, Ravage, O&T Expansion, and ANZACSAS Napalm and WP Smoke marker rockets.
- Added Western Sahara CDLC Real Names for Weapons, Attachments, and Vehicles.
- Added Reaction Forces CDLC Real Names for Weapons, Attachments, and Vehicles.
- Added (and modified some) Real Names for APEX, JETS, LAWS OF WAR, CONTACT DLC that were missing from Ace3's module.
- Converted ALL .cpp files to .bin for faster loading times (thanks Axle for the tip).

KNOWN ISSUES:

- Magazines will reference their usage for weapons of their fictional/Vanilla names when hovered over. I won't make any changes to them (and neither will ace3) as files are encrypted for CDLCs and it will take exponentially more work than just renaming.

+ Reaction Forces CDLC by Rotators Collective
// VEHICLES
// There are a lot of variants to the new Reaction Forces' helicopter. Though they all fall under either the H225 Super Puma (civil-orientated) or the H225M Super Cougar (military designated by the M). Looking through each one in editor (and their customizable components), there are about 7 total unique variants of these helicopters in all. They will be renamed based on their equipment and subsequent roles.
// Available are the fuel probe, exhaust suppressors, floatation bags, and extra (fuel) tanks. A military variant. An H225M Super Cougar, meant for general transport of 20 passengers. No nose-mounted radar. Likely meant for long distance transportation of troops (by ION and Gendarmerie).
- "H240 Transport" -> "H225M Super Cougar Transport" [BLUFOR- Gendarmerie, ION Services]
// NATO variants for the AW159 Wildcat.
- "AH-11F Hellcat" -> "AW159 Wildcat" [BLUFOR- NATO] 
- "AH-11F Hellcat (Unarmed)" -> "AW159 Wildcat (Unarmed)" [BLUFOR- NATO]
// Available are the fuel probe, exhaust suppressors, and floatation bags. A military variant. An H225M Super Cougar, meant for general transport of 20 passengers but also has 2 wing-mounted weapon pylons and a nose-mounted radar. Has no extra (fuel) tanks. Probably meant for Combat Search & Rescue (CSAR) operations in combat zones. 
- "MH-245 Cougar" -> "H225M Super Cougar CSAR" [BLUFOR- NATO]
// Available are the fuel probe, exhaust suppressors, floatation bags. A military variant. An H225M Super Cougar, meant for general transport of 20 troops but has no weapon pylons. Only the nose-mounted radar and extra (fuel) tanks. Likely meant for SAR operations in non-combat zones.
- "MH-245 Cougar (Unarmed)" -> "H225M Super Cougar SAR" [BLUFOR- NATO]
// Only the exhaust suppressors are available. Still a military variant. An H225M Super Cougar, meant for general transport (or evacuation) of 20 troops/civilians but has no weapon pylons. Has no nose-mounted radar or extra (fuel) tanks. Probably meant for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations.
- "RAI-350M Cougar (Unarmed)" -> "H225M Super Cougar HADR" [Independent- AAF, LDF]
// Only the exhaust suppressors are available. A very unique military variant. An H225M Super Cougar but with a nose-mounted 20mm cannon akin to the IAR 330L Puma SOCAT (which was configured for anti-tank and battlefield support operations). Has only 12 passenger seats (instead of 20) due to the cannon ammo, but 4 wing-mounted weapon pylons. Has no nose-mounted radar or extra (fuel) tanks. This variant is likely made to be a SOCAT configuration for the H225M Super Cougar, as the IAR 330L Puma SOCAT was.
- "RAI-360M Cougar" -> "H225M Super Cougar SOCAT" [Independent- AAF, LDF]

- "Tempest Water" -> "Typhoon Water" [Civilian- Civilians]

- "H235C Transport" -> "H225 Super Puma Transport" [Civilian- Civilians, IDAP]
// Only has floatation devices. Certainly a civilian variant. An H225 Super Puma, also meant for transporting 15 passengers. Interior design of the helicopter supports its purpose for being a civilian passenger transport. Just to not be redundant and due to the flotation devices, this will probably be meant for VIPs. Also has extra (fuel) tanks.
- "H240C Transport" -> "H225 Super Puma VIP" [Civilian- Civilians]
// Available are a searchlight and floatation devices. Specifically a civilian variant. An H225 Super Puma, meant for transporting 8 passengers (one is on a stretcher). Also has a nose-mounted radar and extra (fuel) tanks. This variant is tailor made for all-weather search, rescue operations and water bombing.
