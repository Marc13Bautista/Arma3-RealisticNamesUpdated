+ (06/01/24) UPDATED Ace3's stringtable.xml
// VEHICLES
// Capitalized the "(unarmed)" labels for CH-47I Chinook, Ka-60 Kasatka, and AW159 Wildcat that was missed by ace3 module.
// Removed "." in "LSV Mk. II" variants to be consistent with naming.

// DRONES
// Renamed "YABHON-R3" to "MQ-9X Dragonfly" (for English and applicable). Based on the real-life "MQ-9 Reaper" UCAV designed by General Atomics, but also uses forward mounted and rear-swept canard wings that are also reminiscent of Boeing's "X-50 Dragonfly" (cancelled prototype UAV that also used the same wing configuration as the Greyhawk, albeit on a much smaller sized airframe). Following naming conventions and package upgrades of the MQ-9 Reaper (ex: MQ-9B STOL), I think "MQ-9X Dragonfly" is an appropriate fusion name (where "X" designates experimental).
// Renamed "Burraq UCAV" to "CH-3A Rainbow". Based on the real-world "Rainbow" UCAV (more specifically the "CH-3A" variant) developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).
